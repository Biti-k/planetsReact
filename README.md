This web application is useful for looking about some general information of any discovered planet. It uses this api: https://api-ninjas.com/api/planets
It also retrieves the image from a web scraping api https://serper.dev/
Made with React, ThreeJS, Tailwind.
You can try it here (if api's servers aren't down)
Maybe images of the planets are not really accurated! It just displays first image found.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
